            <p>The first step is to know what foods are good for you. It's fairly simple, really — the closer a food
                is to its natural state, the better it is for you.
                Fresh fruits and berries are great and can help satisfy a craving for sweets without adding extra sugar.

                <p>I got the best white chicken chili recipe from my sister-in-law, who made a big batch and served a
                    crowd one night. It was a hit. It’s easy and quick, which is helpful since I’m a college student. In

                <p>
                    Whenever I pass a display of bananas in the grocery store, I can almost smell the wonderful aroma of
                    my best banana bread recipe. It really is amazingly good!

                <p>
                    A local restaurant serves a similar cheeseburger soup but wouldn't share its recipe with me. So I
                    developed my own, modifying a recipe for potato soup.
